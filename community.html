					<div class="panel-body">With winter rolling in, we all tend to retreat into our homes for long periods of time to avoid the frigid cold weather. With the amount of time we are spending indoors, it's surprising how overlooked the importance of air quality truly is. Air is our most basic necessity for survival, yet it is perhaps one of the least thought about needs we have. On average, a human breathes approximately 35 pounds of air a day. Air purifiers do just exactly what their name suggests; they purify air. Below are the top five reasons why an air purifier is beneficial to your household.<br><br>
				<strong>Mold</strong>
					<br>You probably didn't realize your home could mold like a piece of rancid food, but it can. Mold is a type of fungus that relies on only moisture and warmth to grow, and besides being disgusting, it can bring down the value of your house, aswell as seriously impact the health of those around you. Some of the health effects from mold can be dizziness, head aches, naseau, allergies and constant fatigue. The mold that can be found in your walls or ceilings originally reproduce from microscopic spores that float through both indoor and outdoor air. Typically mold can be found in areas of high moisture levels such as bathrooms, basements, and even kitchens. Air purifiers trap the airborne spores in a filter and prevent them from circulating through the house to stick onto the walls and reproducing.<br><br>
				<strong>Allergies</strong>
					<br>Your house is probably dirtier than you realize, and no matter how much you clean you yourself can not clean the air. Pollen, dirt, dust and other airborne particles can all be dragged into our house from the outdoors without us even realizing, and then begin to circulate with the air in our homes. These particles will irritate allergies and cause drastic flare ups with runny noses, sneezing, coughing, watery eyes and itchy skin. Air purifiers work quickly to remove the airborne particles without allowing them to continue circulating and can relieve allergies quickly. Tip: running the air purifier near your front door can meet the allergens and prevent them from entering your home's airflow.<br><br>
				<strong>Asthma</strong>
					<br>Sufferers of asthma have a particularily hard time during the winter, with the constant change in wet to dry air, their symptoms can really flare up and make them vulnerable to illness. It only makes sense to try and prevent their suffering where you can; inside your home. Air purifiers are heavily recommended for those with chronic asthma or bronchitis as it will improve air quality and purity to provide easier breathing. Asthma reactions are commonly ignited by a sensitivity to particular allergens in the air that can restrict the airflow to the lungs. However, a strict warning is given that those with asthma to stay away from air purifiers that emit any type of ozone. Ozone purifiers may mask odors by changing the chemical composition of the gases and particles, but the ozone that is produced can effect the lungs and irritate their asthma/ bronchitis.<br><br>
				<strong>Pets</strong>
					<br>No matter what type of dog or cat you own, it sheds and even the best vacuum cleaner in this world can not possibly get all of the loose hairs. Animals and their hair can greatly contribute to allergies and asthma, however it is not just their hair that can contaminate the air; their urine, saliva and skin can all be sources of pet dander which can stick to furniture, walls and carpets. The particles from the dander can drift and float in the air which will ignite any allergies and can also present an unsanitary condition.  An air purifier will not only help reduce pet odors, but will also trap these unhygenic particles in the filter.<br><br>
				<strong>Cigarette Smoke</strong>
					<br>On the chance that you are in a smoking house, you probably can already guess how harmful it can be. Smoke can pollute the indoor air, stain the walls & furniture, produce strong odors and can contaminate the air, producing second hand smoke harming those around you. Running an air purifier in smoke-heavy rooms can help to remove the smoke particles in the air and help reduce the odor cause by tobacco smoke. A purifier will also trap the toxins from the smoke and prevent any heavy staining of walls, clothing, furniture and carpets.<br><br>

					<div class="panel-body">When winter rolls in, many of us all have the same dreadful thoughts; how cold it's going to be, and how light our wallets get with Holiday spending. So, we did some research and found some of the best energy saving tips to ensure you're staying warm and saving that cash!<br><br>
				<strong>Insulation</strong>
					<br>Were you constantly told by your father to close the door, because "we don't pay to heat the outdoors"? Well, without proper and quality insulation, that's exactly what you're doing! Insulation works as a barrier to keep your warm air inside your house instead of slipping through the cracks. If you are wondering if you have sufficient insulation, check your roof the next time your area gets a typical snow fall. If your roof is holding the snow and it does not appear to be melting, your roof has proper insulation. If, however, your roof is bare and the tiles are visible, it is most likely that heat loss is occuring.<br><br>
				<strong>Furnace Maintenance</strong>
					<br>Furnace maintenance is crucial to saving energy and keeping your house warm! The filters may need cleaning or replacing (on average it should be checked every 2-3 months) and your air flow may be restricted due to the dust and debris blocking the passage way. CoolHeat Comfort Systems currently is running a promotion for 50% off a winter furnace tune-up to guarantee your furnace is efficient, clean and of course, safe. Call them at (613) 366-1200 to book an appointment.<br><br>
				<strong>Furnace Replacement</strong>
					<br>If your furnace is more than 15-20 years old and servicing it just isn't an option, consider replacing it altogether with a new, high efficiency model. Not only will the new furnace perform more efficienctly to save you money on your bill, but the provincial government has many new incentive plans and rebates to encourage the purchase of a new furnace. CoolHeat Comfort Systems offers savings of $1000.00 when purchasing a new furnace. Visit them on the web at www.coolheatcomfort.ca to learn more.<br><br>
				<strong>Layer Up</strong>
					<br>Sometimes that lingering chill can be ultimately traced back to your own body heat. If you still find yourself cold even in a warm house, layer up! Throw on some warm clothes, and remember to wear socks and if need be a hat, as the feet and head are especially vulnerable areas for body heat loss. Once you begin to warm up internally, feel free to turn the thermostat down to a comfortable room termperature. It may seem simple, but it will save you money!<br><br>
				<strong>Weather Stripping</strong>
					<br>Check your house for drafts, specifically the door frames for your house entrances as well as all the windows in your household. If you feel any wind or air coming from the frames, install weather stripping. Another alternative is using clean plastic sheeting for your windows which will add a protective layer to cover any cracks.<br><br>
				<strong>Shut the Flute!</strong>
					<br>If you happen to have a wood-burning fireplace in your home, always remember to shut the flute whenever it is not in use. If the flute is left open, your warm air will rise up and out through it, and it will also allow the current of cold air into the room.<br><br>
				<strong>Utilize Curtains</strong>
					<br>During the winter there are only a few precious hours of sunlight, and while the rays may not be as strong as they are during the Summer, you can still harvest the heat! During the day when the sun is out, open your curtains and blind to add some extra warmth (and light!) to your house. Then, once it is night, make sure to close all the curtains and blinds in order to help keep that heat trapped inside.<br><br>
				<strong>Close off Vents</strong>
					<br>The size of your home can play a large factor in how warm it is. While it is nice to have spare rooms, always try to close up any unused space in your home. By shutting the doors you'll only be heating the rooms you use. It is imperative to also close off the air vents leading to any unused space as well. When multiple vents are open, the air flow becomes weaker in all rooms; closing some vents will produce stronger, warmer air in the rooms you do use.<br><br>
				<strong>Turn off the Heat</strong>
					<br>But only for the right reasons! If your house is empty for long, extended periods of time you shouldn't be bothering to heat it. Even if you are leaving a dog or cat in the house, it is safe to atleast turn the thermostat down to 16°C. Keep in mind, they are basically already wearing a fur coat.<br><br>
				<strong>Open the Oven!</strong>
					<br>This simple tip is especially helpful considering all the cooking and baking that is usually done during the holidays. If you just finished baking a dish and are finding the kitchen somewhat chilly, open that door up and let the heat escape around you. Why let that warmth (and delicious smell) go to waste?<br><br>

				<div id="collapse6" class="panel-collapse collapse">
					<div class="panel-body">Many people do not realize that you can efficienctly heat your home with the same gas we use in our barbecues; propane. Heating with propane will not only lower your utility costs, but will also make your home more comfortable and reduce your impact on the environment. Below I have outlined many of the benefits with heating your home with propane.<br><br>
				<strong>Affordable</strong>
					<br>Heating your home with propane can save you a good chunk of change. It's shown on average that propane costs half as much per BTU as electric heating. People who make the switch to gas/ propane heating tend to see serious changes in their heating bill, most saving up to $1500.00 annually! Other ways you save is that propane gas fireplaces cost 30-60% less per hour of operation than using a wood burning fireplace.<br><br>
				<strong>Reliable</strong>
					<br>Propane and natural gas tend to be more reliable than electricty. By using a gas as your heat source, you ensure that your house is still operational during an electric power outage. If a power outage is to occur, your home will still have heat & hot water, as well as most cooking appliances. Propane will continue to operate even in the worst of weather conditions. When living in the country, some houses can be without heat and hot water for up to 48 hours when power outages occur due to their distance from major cities.<br><br>
				<strong>Warmer</strong>
					<br>Most people do not realize that heating with propane will actually keep your house warmer aswell, so you get more and save doing so! On average, a propaane heating system is approximately 20 degrees warmer when compared to an electric heat pump.<br><br>
				<strong>Efficient</strong>
					<br>Propane water heaters are also a commodity that can benefit a household as not only do they cost close to 30% less to operate, but they also restore two and a half times faster than an electric water heater. On average, you are able to reheat a whole tankful of water in just under 20 minutes with propane compared to over an hour with an electric heat source.<br><br>
				<strong>Available</strong>
					<br>Convenient and portable, propane is an energy source that can be used virtually anywhere, from the country to the city. As of right now, Enbridge, the leading gas provider in Ontario, has yet to make it to all small communities on the outskirts of the major cities but has plans to do so in the coming years. The benefit of using propane for heating is that once gas is made available in your community, it is an extremely easy conversion to change from propane to natural gas heating.<br><br>
				<strong>Environmentally Friendly</strong>
					<br>In a time when keeping our planet green is so important, it is crucial to reduce your carbon footprint, and heating with propane/natural gas can help do that. Propane creates far less pollution than the giant power plants that supply your house with electricity. Propane provides a cleaner, more breathable air and is also insoluble in water, so it presents absolutely no risk to soil and ground water supplies. Propane also is in a reusable tank and can be recycled into many different things if and when the<br><br>
				<strong>Propane is Safe</strong>
					<br>What is more important to your than your safety? Everything about propane is safe, the production, storage, transportation and use are all subject to strict standards and regulations enforced by your provider. Propane tanks have been proven to be 20 times more puncture-proof than the average oil tank.<br><br>
					Tired of waiting for Enbridge to bring gas heating to your neighborhood? Call CoolHeat Comfort Systems today at (613) 366-1200 to make the switch to Propane heating! You'll save big, and when natural gas makes it way to your area your propane furnace can easily be converted for natural gas. Visit us on the web at www.coolheatcomfort.ca to learn more!</div>

					<div class="panel-body">
				<strong>What are some of the benefits of natural gas heating?</strong>
					<br>One of the most important benefits of natural gas heating is that it is generally more economical than oil based heating. Heating with natural gas is approximately half the price of heating with oil, so for example, if you are currently spending roughly $5000.00 a year with oil heating, you are likely to be spending close to $2500.00 a year with natural gas. Natural gas is also a more convenient way to heat your home as more gas customers avoid heavy maintenance and equipment costs that are usually associated with oil based heat such as pumps, motors, and permits. Also, with natural gas it is a more reliable resource that is piped directly into your home, so there is no need to rely on deliveries for more fuel. Finally, natural gas is genuinely a safer, and more enviromentally friendly, source of heat.<br><br>
				<strong>What is the overall cost to convert from an oil heating system to a gas system?</strong>
					<br>There is no way to calculate an exact dollar amount for a conversion as many factors contribute to the price. The cost can vary depending on the size and efficiency of the furnace/ boiler, contractor labor costs, and the piping requirements in the home or business. A typical conversation project can run anywhere from $2000.00 to $4000.00.<br>
					To get the lowest quote, call CoolHeat Comfort Systems at (613) 366-1200.<br><br>
				<strong>How long will the conversion process take?</strong>
					<br>The duration of the conversion can depend on quite a few factors including the schedule and responsibilities of a customer and the provider, and the wait time of the municipality that issues work permits and construction stipulations.<br><br>
				<strong>If I convert to natural gas heating, can I also keep my oil tanks?</strong>
					<br>This is something you will need to verify with your licensed technician to ensure all aspects of the conversion are in regulation with any local municipal, provincial or federal requirements. Some municipalities may require you to disconnect and remove your existing oil tanks.<br><br>
				<strong>What is the typical payback period for my investment in gas heating?</strong>
					<br>With a high-efficiency gas heating installation, the payback period could vary between 12-30 months. In retrospect, your previous oil heating system was most likely inefficient and therefore, costly. Depending on the age of your oil heating system, it's operating level could be as low at 60%. With a new gas heating system, the efficiency can range to levels higher than 95%. It is common to achieve anywhere from 20-50% in energy savings when installing a high-efficiency natural gas heating system.<br><br>

				</h4><p>Thursday, November 5, 2015 | Emily Mackenzie</p>
				</div>
				<div id="collapse4" class="panel-collapse collapse">
					<div class="panel-body"><strong>Disclaimer: The following article is a guideline to diagnosing minor issues with your gas furnace. These are simply tips and suggestions for running minimum diagnostic problems before calling your heating repairman. We here at Hot Head and CoolHeat Comfort Systems DO NOT endorse running any repairs on your equipment yourself, and if you are uncomfortable in any way while interacting with the furnace, do not proceed. Your safety, and your comfort is the most important thing.</strong>
					<br><br>
					What most people don't know, is any type of service call to a heating repair company is subject to charge. There are stories about people being billed simply for a technician to show up only to find out the thermostat was turned off. The following are a list of steps to take before calling your heating repair provider.
					<br><br>
					<strong>1.</strong> The first, and easiest step is always checking if the furnace switch is put to the "on" position. It may sound silly, but any technical support agent from any business will always ask you to confirm your appliance is turned on. This happens more often than any of us would like to admit, but don't blame yourself, someone else in your household could've easily switched the heat off.
					<br><br>
					<strong>2.</strong> Check your filter! A dirty filter is the most common reason for your furnace to stop working altogether, or for it's performance to severely drop. When a filter is dirty, it can cause dangerous overheating issues, or the dust and obstructions can actually block the air flow altogether, not allowing the heat to reach all areas of your household. Professionals highly suggest that your filters be cleaned or replaced every 2-3 months.
					<br><br>
					<strong>3.</strong> Tally how many of your registers are closed or blocked off. Experts suggest never closing off more than 20% of the registers in your household as it can cause unnecessary heat build up in the furnace, and can cause high resistance in the equipment. Closing some registers may direct the heat where it is most needed in the house, but if you exceed over the suggested limit of 20%, you can risk damage to your heating system.
					<br><br>
					<strong>4.</strong> Confirm that the door cover is attached correctly. If the cover is not on perfectly, your furnace will not allow itself to start up. This is most common after a routine filter change or cleaning, so always double check after upkeep has been performed.
					<br><br>
					<strong>5.</strong> Another easily resolved issue is to double check that the gas supply is turned on. Your furnace can be turned on, but if your gas supply is off, the air actually has no heat source. Most gas units will contain a pilot light to notify you of where it is on and operational.
					<br><br>
					<strong>6.</strong> Confirm your thermostat selector switch is on the heat setting. If it is, attempt to raise the room temperature by an extra 5-10 degrees. By switching the setting higher than the current room temperature, your furnace will be forced to kick start back up to accomodate your request.
					<br><br>
					<strong>7.</strong> While adjusting the thermostat controls, try to remember the last time the batteries were changed. If the thermostat batteries are low, your system will be completely down.
					<br><br>
					<strong>8.</strong> Check to see if the venting for your furnace is blocked by snow, ice, or any other obstructions. Any blockage can damage your equipment long term, and can prevent the travel of the air flow. Most importantly, a blockage in your venting can be hazardous.
					<br><br>
					<strong>9.</strong> If your furnace has a blower fan on/auto button, check to see that it is currently on. Although this is not an extremely common problem, someone in your household could've accidently bumped into it and switched it unknowingly.
					<br><br>
					<strong>10.</strong> Most importantly, have you paid your heating bill? It may sound silly, but sometimes bills can slip the mind, and if your service is cut you won't have access to your heating supply.

				<strong>1. Warranty's can be easily void.</strong>
					<br>Alot of furnace installers will provide promises of a worry free warranty that almost always sounds too good to be true. Many warranty's come in terms of 5-10 years, and while the companies can make them sound hassle free, there is plenty they are NOT telling you. For example, many warranty's become void without the proper maintenance and cleaning required for optimum performance. Most companies will forget to inform you of this, and it can cost you a large amount of money in future repairs and maintenance.<br><br>
				<strong>2. Savings can vary from household to household.</strong>
					<br>It's not hard to find a company that advertises large amounts of savings before even talking to their clients. While upgrading your equiptment and switching your providers can easily save you a large amount of money, there are other factors to consider on why you are paying as much as you are monthly. The size of the house can easily contribute to how much you are spending, as a larger house has a bigger space to heat. Also, something as easy as poor insulation can contribute to high prices on your heating bills.<br><br>
				<strong>3. Certificates and Licensing are essential!</strong>
					<br>As a consumer, you always have a right to ask about the certification and licensing of a company. This is especially important with furnace and gas instalation as you can litterally be playing with fire. By law, gas technicians must have their gas ticket license in order to legally and safely instal any gas product in your home. Qualified companies should also posses liability insurance, WSIB insurance for employees, and should be TSSA registered with their number visibly displayed. Do not be afraid to ask about a company's credientials, insurance and references. It's your home, and your safety, at risk.<br>

We will be upfront in our assesments and educate you in our outstanding 7 or 10 year warranty's. All of our technicians are professional, reliable, and fully licensed and ceritifed.

				<strong>1. Savings!</strong>
					<br>By switching to natural gas heating, you have the ultimate potential to save about $1000.00 annually on your heating bill. It's no secret that oil is at an all time high and doesn't seem to ever go down, and while gas prices can rise it is nowhere near the crude prices of oil. In Canada, heating with oil is approximately double the price of heating with gas, where heating with electricity can be as high as 3.5 to 4 times as much as heating with gas.<br><br>
				<strong>2. Convenience</strong>
					<br>With using gas heating, you will have an endless supply unlike oil where you may run out prematurely. Natual gas is also 100% reliable! A gas consumer never has to worry about running out of gas, and never has to arrange for deliveries or sudden, unexpected expenses. The best thing about the reliability of natural gas? Many of the appliciances will still be functionable during a power outage, so no worries about losing heating or warm water.<br><br>
				<strong>3. Versatility</strong>
					<br>There's more to natural gas than just heating through your furnace! It can also provide you with constant warm water, quick and easy cooking, fireplaces, and less energy consuming appliciances. In addition, it can also be used for your outdoor areas with heating your swimming pool/ hot tub and providing fuel to your barbeque.<br><br>
				<strong>4. Home Value</strong>
					<br>Considering natural gas is the most popular method of heating in Canada, switching to natural gas, or installing a new furnace, will increase the value of your home when it comes time to sell.<br><br>
				<strong>5. Safety</strong>
					<br>Most importantly out of this list, natural gas is one of the world's safest energy sources. Natural gas is used by almost half of the population of Canada. The risks of fire, explosion or carbon monoxide poisoning is seriously reduced when using natural gas as a heating source in your household.<br><br>
